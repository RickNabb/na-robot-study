                        What is this study about?
                    </p>
                    <p>Researchers at Tufts University are conducting a study on how people trust robots in various settings. The purpose of the research is to understand how people trust robots in different ways and in different scenarios. You are being asked to participate because we are interested in how people solve these tasks. You are one of several dozen participants to take part in this study. Your participation in the study is expected to last about 15-20 minutes.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <p>What will happen during this research?</p>
                    <p>If you agree to be in this research, your participation will include answering demographic questions, reading human-robot interaction scenarios, and post-scenario questions. You will have the option to skip any post-scenario questions that make you uncomfortable. </p>
                    <p>We will tell you about any new information that may affect your willingness to continue participation in this research.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <p>What will you do to protect my privacy?</p>
                    <p>
                        The results of the study may be published. We will take measures to protect your privacy and confidentiality including storing your data (survey responses, demographics) on a secure server or password-protected computer that can only be accessed with a private login. Only the researchers will have access to your data. The results of this study may be published or presented at a scientific meeting. Despite taking steps to protect your privacy, we can never fully guarantee your privacy will be protected. Because we can only allow people to participate once in this study, we are collecting  MTurk Worker IDs to keep track of who participated. Your data will be stored separately from your MTurk Worker ID.
                    </p>
                    <p>Individuals and organizations responsible for conducting or monitoring this research may be permitted access to and inspect the research records. This includes Tufts Social, Behavioral & Educational Research Institutional Review Board (Tufts SBER IRB) and the researchers conducting the study.</p>
                    <p>If identifiers are removed from your identifiable private information that are collected during this research, that de-identified information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without your additional informed consent.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <p>What are the risks or discomforts associated with this research?</p>
                    <p>A very small amount of risk will exist due to our storage of your data from the task. However, none of the tasks in this study should cause any embarrassment or reveal anything sensitive about you.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <p>How might I benefit from this research?</p>
                    <p>There may be no personal benefit from your participation but the knowledge received may be of value to humanity.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <p>What is the compensation for the research?</p>
                    <p>You will receive $2 for participating in this study. You need to reach the end of the study to receive compensation. You also need to pass our attention check questions to be compensated.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>What will happen if I choose not to participate?</p>

                    <p>Is my participation voluntary, and can I withdraw?</p>
                    <p>Taking part in this research study is your decision. Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to take part in this study, but if you do, you can stop at any time. Your decision whether to participate will not affect your relationship with the researchers or Tufts University. There are no consequences if you do not participate.</p>
                    <p>You have the right to choose not to participate in any study activity or completely withdraw from continued participation at any point in this study without consequences.</p>
                    <p>If you want to withdraw from the study you need to close the browser before reaching the end of the study. Your data will be discarded.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>We can remove you from the research study without your approval. Reasons we would do this include technical malfunctions with the experimental setup or failure to answer the attention check questions.</p>
                    <br/>

                    <p>Who do I talk to if I have questions?</p>
