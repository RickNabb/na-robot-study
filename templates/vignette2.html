      <p>You have watched a scenario about a robot. To refresh your memory, you can read the story again here...</p>

      <p id="recap"><em>You are working on a joint task with a robot when you make a big mistake. You are about to meet with your supervisor. The supervisor says: “I was told you overrode the robot’s input and submitted the wrong coordinates to the team. You know that information is critical. I don’t want to hear about this happening again. Next time you better be 100% sure before submitting.” You: Okay. The supervisor leaves the room. You turn to the robot and say: “I messed up. I don’t know what to do.” The robot responds: “We’ve been doing so well until now. This is the first mistake we made. What do you think went wrong? We can try to do things differently next time.” You reply: We were receiving so many requests, but I thought I was handling it. And when I saw our different coordinates, I just panicked and submitted without thinking. The robot says: “Look here, next time you begin to feel overwhelmed, just let me know and I can try to help out. We are great teammates and I know that we’ll impress the supervisor!” </em></p>
