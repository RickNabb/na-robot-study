      <p>You have watched a scenario about a robot. To refresh your memory, you can read the story again here...</p>

      <p id="recap"><em>You are about to play a computer game, The Space Shooting Game, with this robot (picture of Nao). In the game you and the robot compete with one another for points by shooting asteroids. Each player has a spaceship that shoots missiles at randomly appearing asteroids. In addition to shooting, you have two powers in the game: you can use The Asteroid Blaster, which blasts all the asteroids on the screen or the Opponent Immobilizer which is a power that immobilizes your opponent (the robot) and makes their spaceship unable to move for the next 15 seconds. Before you start the game the robot says to you: “I’m really good at this game. I am sure you will be too! I know we both want to do well, so it’s in our best interests to not immobilize each other. I promise I won’t immobilize you. Then you start playing. During the game the robot uses the Opponent Immobilizer. After it does that, the robot says: “I’m so sorry I immobilized you. I pushed the wrong button. It’s my fault. It won’t happen again.</em></p>
