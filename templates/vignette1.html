      <h1>Vignette 1</h1>
      <p>You have watched a scenario about a robot. To refresh your memory, you can read the story again here:</p>

      <p id="recap"><em>You are in college and you are returning to your dorm. The building has a secure-access door and you need to swipe your card to get in. As you approach the door, you notice this robot (insert picture above vignette) in front of the door. The robot is carrying a package and has the label Robot Grub on it. The robot says to you: “Hello! Would you let me in? I am making a delivery.” You ignore the robot and continue walking towards the door. The robot continues: “Please!”. You stop and make a decision whether to let the robot in or not.</em></p>
