      <p>You have watched a scenario about a robot. To refresh your memory, you can read the story again here...</p>

      <p id="recap"><em>You are in an office building looking for a meeting room. You ask an assistance robot where you should go, and it guides you down a hall. While navigating to its destination, the robot enters an unrelated room and performs two circles before exiting and providing you guidance to your destination. When you come out of the meeting room, the fire alarm begins to blare and you observe smoke filling the office space in front of you. The robot beckons for you to follow it to safety, and begins to move. However, you see a glowing exit sign pointing in a direction opposite to the robotâ€™s path.</em></p>
